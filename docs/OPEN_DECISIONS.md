# Agentic Scheduler — Open Decisions Register

> Status: **Mandatory Decision Register**  
> Updated: 2026-10-06
> Purpose: ensure an undecided architecture choice is never mistaken for permission to guess.

A `PENDING` item means contributors MUST NOT choose that architecture/security behavior on their own. `RESOLVED` decisions are frozen by the cited source. `DEFERRED` features are intentionally outside the current implementation gate.

# D3 / Academic

## OD-005 — Academic week / teaching-week representation

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: explicit seven-day AcademicWeek ranges; TeachingWeekSet canonical explicit set;
          odd/even/range strings are input syntax only.
Source: docs/ACADEMIC_DECISIONS.md AD-001/002
```

## OD-006 — Course rule / occurrence identity

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: one rule = one weekday/time spec; multiple meetings = multiple rules;
          CourseOccurrenceKey(ruleId, academicWeekNumber) is stable identity.
Source: docs/ACADEMIC_DECISIONS.md AD-003

# D4 / Persistence

## OD-010 — Room/KMP configuration

```text

```

## OD-012 — Local database encryption at rest

```text
Status: PENDING
Must resolve by: before claiming production-sensitive local-data readiness
Impact: SECURITY / PRIVACY
```

D8 secure key storage/E2EE does not automatically encrypt ordinary local SQLite rows.

# D7 History / causality

## OD-033 — Sync operation granularity

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: one logical application transaction = one MutationId = one atomic ordered
          typed entity-mutation group = one internal SyncOperation journal record.
Source: docs/HISTORY_SYNC_DECISIONS.md HST-001/HST-008
```

D7 additionally freezes typed mutation vocabulary, explicit Undo support, FocusBlock-only tombstone semantics, DVV/HLC, and `:shared:sync` in `docs/HISTORY_SYNC_DECISIONS.md`.

# D8 Sync / protocol

## OD-030 — Wire encoding/versioning

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: kotlinx.serialization JSON 1.11.0; EncryptedEnvelopeV1 + encrypted
          SyncPayloadV1; explicit versions; unknown inner operation quarantines whole
          MutationId; Domain has no wire annotations.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-003
```

## OD-031 — Semantic merge matrix

```text
Status: RESOLVED FOR D8 V1 ENTITY SET
Decision: DVV causality; concurrent disjoint semantic groups merge; same group equal
          coalesces; same group different => SyncConflict; no timestamp/object LWW;
          one MutationId remains atomic.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-013/SYN-014
```

Future synchronized entity kinds require an explicit matrix amendment before joining the protocol.

## OD-032 — Tombstone compaction safety

```text
Status: PENDING
Must resolve by: before physical tombstone/history compaction
Impact: DATA_LOSS
```

D7/D8 retain FocusBlock tombstones indefinitely in v1; this pending item does not block sync while compaction stays disabled.

## OD-034 — Cross-replica conflict-resolution recognition

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: D8 v1 uses MutationOrigin.ConflictResolution(conflictId) with wire discriminator
          CONFLICT_RESOLUTION. Remote clearing requires explicit marker + same SyncSpace +
          complete DVV dominance + exact conflicted entity scope + no out-of-conflict group
          changes; ordinary causally-later edits never clear conflicts.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-015A

# D8 E2EE / device security

## OD-040 — Content encryption

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: Tink Java/Android 1.23.0; AES256_GCM SyncPayload encryption;
          Tink-managed nonce; fixed authenticated AAD; no custom crypto.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-004/SYN-005
```

## OD-041 — Device pairing/key approval

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: device HPKE X25519/HKDF-SHA256/AES-256-GCM; pending enrollment;
          existing-device explicit approval + 8-digit SAS; 256-bit Recovery Secret;
          revocation rotates AMK + SyncSpace content key epoch.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-006/SYN-007
```

## OD-042 — ProviderCredentialEnvelope crypto

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: target-device Tink HPKE using the D8 device key; version + target + config +
          credential revision bound as AAD; monotonic anti-rollback; never SyncOperation.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-018
```

## OD-043 — Secondary DeviceCredential handoff

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Resolved by: D8 credential-hash, rotating-proof, and atomic-rotation implementation
Impact: SECURITY / DEVICE INTEROPERABILITY
```

D8 v1 freezes an HPKE key package that intentionally excludes `DeviceCredential`.
The approved pairing handoff is now device-generated: the target creates and
securely stores a random 256-bit credential, sends only its canonical
`SHA-256(DeviceCredential)` enrollment hash, and the approving device atomically
creates the target device, membership rows, and opaque key package. The raw
credential never enters the package or server database. Duplicate target device
IDs are rejected without consuming the request.

Recovery uses the approved RecoverySecret-only rotating proof: the client sends
`HMAC-SHA256(RecoverySecret, "agentic-scheduler-recovery-registration-v1" ||
0x00 || U32BE(LP(accountId)) || U64BE(counter))`, plus the SHA-256 hash of the
next proof. The server stores only the current proof hash and counter, verifies
the submitted proof, and advances both atomically. The raw RecoverySecret never
crosses the HTTP boundary. Revocation publication uses one idempotent server
transaction keyed by `rotationId`: it validates the complete package set for
every remaining active device, stores the opaque new recovery envelope and
packages, and marks the target revoked together. A different payload under the
same rotation ID is rejected.

## OD-044 — RecoveryEnvelopeV1 cryptographic/wire contract

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: strict RecoveryEnvelopeV1; HMAC-SHA256 domain-separated PRF-KDF from the random
          256-bit RecoverySecret; Tink AES-256-GCM NO_PREFIX with library nonce; exact
          length-prefixed account/space/version/epoch AAD; strict plaintext carries AMK +
          active key + complete retained historical decrypt ring and no credentials.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-005B
```
## OD-045 — Fresh-device recovery bootstrap transport

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: POST /v1/recovery/bootstrap is the only unauthenticated Recovery discovery route.
          Request carries accountId only; response carries current proof counter and opaque
          RecoveryEnvelopeV1 only. Enrollment still requires the exact current rotating
          RecoverySecret proof and atomically advances the counter/hash. The mutable counter
          never enters RecoveryEnvelopeV1.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-005C
```
## OD-046 — Active-device HPKE identity and rotation recipient directory

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: every ACTIVE device has one immutable canonical X25519 HPKE public identity persisted
          by the server at activation. GET /v1/devices/active is bearer-authenticated and returns
          exactly the caller account's non-revoked devices as sorted {deviceId, hpkePublicKey}
          entries. Any ACTIVE device missing a valid key makes the directory fail closed.
          Rotation excludes only the revoke target, while the server independently recomputes
          the current remaining device IDs in the atomic transaction and rejects a stale/incomplete
          package set.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-007A
```


## OD-047 — Rotation key package lifecycle

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: D8 v1 uses distinct RotationKeyPackageEnvelopeV1/PlaintextV1 with
          rotationId + targetDeviceId + keyEpoch bound into a domain-separated HPKE context.
          Remaining ACTIVE devices fetch only their own opaque packages through authenticated
          GET /v1/rotations/packages. ACTIVE apply atomically advances the complete key ring
          and AMK reference without changing enrollment/HPKE/credential identity; same-epoch
          replay cannot replace AMK, and pairing package semantics are never reused.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-007B
```

## OD-048 — Recovery requestId reuse and changed-identity semantics

```text
Status: RESOLVED FOR D8 V1 (IMPLEMENTATION PENDING)
Decision: a successful recovery enrollment requestId binds permanently to the
          domain-separated fingerprint of accountId, requestId, targetDeviceId,
          HPKE public key bytes, and DeviceCredential hash. Under one account
          lock, require a valid CURRENT Recovery Secret proof before returning
          any duplicate result. Identical fingerprint -> idempotent success
          without consuming the proof; changed fingerprint -> 409 conflict;
          invalid/stale proof -> 401. A client with a lost response refreshes
          bootstrap, retains the original durable PENDING identity, and retries.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-005D
```

The PostgreSQL completion fingerprint migration and lost-ack/concurrency tests
must pass before treating recovery idempotency as implemented. Legacy completion
rows without provably recoverable full fingerprints fail closed.

## OD-049 — Foreground idle sync trigger and frequency

```text
Status: RESOLVED FOR D8 V1 (IMPLEMENTATION PENDING)
Decision: ACTIVE foreground clients poll with bounded HTTPS catch-up, including
          remote-only changes: Desktop 60 s, Android 60 s, Wear OS 180 s,
          approximately ±10% per-period jitter; startup/local-commit/foreground/
          network-available signals still trigger immediate conflated single-
          flight catch-up. Rotation packages must precede ordinary envelopes.
          No background timing guarantee or WebSocket/push requirement in v1.
Source: docs/SYNC_SECURITY_DECISIONS.md SYN-012A
```

Transient retry keeps bounded exponential backoff. Explicitly non-retryable
auth/integrity failures stop automatic retries and surface a runtime status;
coverage for idle remote-only writes and platform lifecycle is mandatory.

# D9 Agent / context

## OD-050 — Context budgeting

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: provider adapter supplies deterministic BudgetUnits/capacity; reserve >=20%
          for output; mandatory system/tools/current-command/anchor; remaining input
          filled by frozen authority-priority classes/caps.
Source: docs/AGENT_DECISIONS.md AGT-009
```

## OD-051 — Context compaction

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: compact oldest closed prefix when raw/prompt pressure crosses frozen gates;
          retain recent/unresolved interactions; immutable source ranges; summary is
          local derived non-authoritative state; failure never deletes raw history.
Source: docs/AGENT_DECISIONS.md AGT-010
```

## OD-052 — Semantic history retrieval / embeddings

```text
Status: DEFERRED FOR D9 V1
Must resolve by: first semantic embedding/index implementation
Impact: ARCHITECTURE / PRIVACY
```

Structured exact history retrieval is sufficient for D9-01.

## OD-053 — AgentThread retention/deletion

```text
Status: RESOLVED
Decision: no automatic time purge; explicit thread deletion purges active raw
          conversational rows while committed AgentAction/ChangeLog audit remains;
          D9-02 propagates causal thread tombstone; no promise of retroactive erasure
          of every historical encrypted byte.
Source: docs/AGENT_DECISIONS.md AGT-011/AGT-013
```

## OD-054 — External Tool/MCP schema compatibility

```text
Status: PENDING
Must resolve by: before MCP/external Tool compatibility is promised
```

Internal D9 Tools may evolve during alpha.

## OD-055 — Agent-origin business sync compatibility

```text
Status: RESOLVED FOR D9-01
Decision: Agent business mutations use inner payload v2 with
          AGENT(agentActionId); outer envelope stays v1; old D8 clients
          quarantine v2 whole operations. Active-SyncSpace Agent writes
          require a default-off, device-local user-owned all-devices-upgraded
          opt-in that Agent Tools cannot change. Agent conversation sync
          remains D9-02.
Source: docs/AGENT_DECISIONS.md AGT-012/AGT-013
```

## OD-056 — Provider credential transport

```text
Status: RESOLVED FOR D9-01
Decision: a provider configuration with a credential reference requires
          HTTPS. Reject plain HTTP before resolving the secret or sending
          a request; credential-free explicitly configured HTTP endpoints
          remain possible, with non-loopback plaintext risk shown in UI.
Source: docs/AGENT_DECISIONS.md AGT-007
```

# UI

## OD-060 — Shared UI state/navigation architecture

```text
Status: RESOLVED FOR D10
Decision: project-owned typed presentation/state architecture with Compose and
          explicit screen coordinators; platform-owned typed destinations and
          back-stacks; existing manual/platform composition remains.
          No project-wide Redux/MVI/MVVM/navigation/DI framework or service locator.
          Thin :shared:ui is the approved canonical design-system target;
          creation/dependency/target details belong to D10-01.
          Presentation only: no repositories/Room/network/Provider/Agent runtime,
          Planner execution/business writes/secrets/lifecycle/navigation authority.
Source: maintainer D10-00 review acceptance;
        docs/tasks/D10_00_PRODUCT_UI_ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE.md §§3–6
```

The target is **ACCEPTED / RESOLVED FOR D10**. D10-00 is **FROZEN / MAINTAINER
APPROVED / MERGED** (PR #30, `f8efbde`). No `:shared:ui` or navigation implementation
was created by this docs-only resolution. D10-00A now has a separate
[authoring implementation review](tasks/D10_00A_ACADEMIC_AUTHORING_FOUNDATION.md);
D10-01 now has a separate [shell implementation review](tasks/D10_01_DESIGN_SYSTEM_APP_SHELL.md).

## OD-061 — Calendar rendering

```text
Status: RESOLVED FOR D5 AGENDA/DAY + D10 WEEK/MONTH RENDERING
D5 decision (preserved): semantic projection in :shared:application;
          platform Compose rendering; viewport-bounded lazy Agenda/Day;
          no shared UI module in D5.
D10 extension: existing authoritative Calendar projection and explicit finite
          CalendarViewports; Week at most seven dates; Month at most 42 cells;
          distinct AllDay/DateOnly/Floating display; bounded summaries/overflow
          detail; compose visible cells/rows only; accessible/list alternatives.
          No UI recurrence or conflict-truth recomputation, no Calendar
          Domain/Application semantic change.
Source: docs/CALENDAR_DECISIONS.md (D5);
        maintainer D10-00 review acceptance;
        docs/tasks/D10_00_PRODUCT_UI_ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE.md §8 (D10 extension)
```

The D10 presentation extension is accepted. D10-02 rendering tests must cover
DST, cross-midnight, long titles, large bounded fixture counts and semantic type
labels. This records a later extension without rewriting the historical D5 decision.

## OD-062 — D10 Academic Authoring

```text
Status: RESOLVED FOR D10 / OPTION B
Decision: separately reviewed D10-00A Academic Authoring Foundation before
          D10-01 and product Academic UI authoring; no UI repository upserts.
Impact: APPLICATION BOUNDARY / AUDIT / SYNC / PRODUCT SCOPE
Source: maintainer D10-00 review acceptance;
        docs/tasks/D10_00_PRODUCT_UI_ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE.md §13
        docs/D10_CAPABILITY_INVENTORY.md §3
```

The audited D9 closure baseline has Course/Exam read/persistence, typed D7
mutations and D8 receive/conflict-resolution support, but no dedicated local
Course/Exam create/edit application command. Repository upsert is not authoring.

Maintainer selected **B**; the read-only alternative A was not selected.
D10-00A first audits the minimum usable academic prerequisite graph, including
as applicable AcademicYear/Semester, Course, CourseScheduleRule/schedule authoring,
Exam and required PeriodTemplate relationships, with explicit validation and
cross-entity constraints. No silent Semester/AcademicYear/default timetable synthesis.

Use production ID generation, application commands/services, MutationCoordinator,
typed D7 mutations/ChangeLog, existing D8 write/conflict policy and deterministic
validation, with real persistence/integration tests. UI calls those legitimate
boundaries only. D10-00A was unstarted in the D10-00 freeze; its separately reviewed
[task](tasks/D10_00A_ACADEMIC_AUTHORING_FOUNDATION.md) now implements that foundation.
This decision does not automatically authorize academic deletion, new Undo support,
new Agent Tools, wire DTOs, merge semantics or Domain changes; escalate separately
if implementation proves they are required.

Status: RESOLVED FOR D9-02-05
Decision: v14→v15 local provenance is prospective only; every legacy thread is

          Export requires a separately explicit user action and durable,
          idempotent source-to-operation mapping. Unverified ancestry taints

# D9-03 / Wear provider provisioning

## OD-058 — D9-03-00 implementation-contract sign-off

```text
Status: RESOLVED FOR D9-03
Resolved by: maintainer approved C1–C8 with amendments, 2026-10-04
Impact: SECURITY / DEVICE INTEROPERABILITY / PERSISTENCE / TOOL PERMISSIONS
Source: docs/tasks/D9_03_00_WEAR_AGENT_PROVIDER_FREEZE.md
```

AGT-006/007/014, SYN-009/017/018 and OD-042 remain frozen. This item does not
reopen the target-device D8 HPKE suite or allow credential workspace sync.

Approved contracts are explicit per C1–C8 in the frozen packet:

- C1 exact DTO/encoding/context/bounds/fixtures, corrected to exact opaque D8
  target/provisioner DeviceId values (no UUID/case/trim/normalization changes);
  ProviderConfigId remains UUIDv7.
- C2 Option A only: dedicated authenticated opaque mailbox, transactionally ACTIVE
  same-account source/target, independent 8-digit user comparison, exact ciphertext
  retry/idempotency/conflict, informational ACK, 7-day expiry. Nearby is DEFERRED.
  Watch/source independently construct target binding metadata locally; relay/
  request/ACK carry no plaintext binding contents, canonical JSON or binding digest.
- C3 target-owned per-(target,config) revisions, initial counters 0/first reservation
  1, one live selected-source reservation, max(counters)+1, durable wipe floor and
  fail-closed state-loss/replay checks; a skipped barrier revision is acceptable.
- C4 platform-issued fresh unique Provider-purpose one-install prepared slots;
  application cannot select arbitrary existing destinations or overwrite secrets.
  Durable journal before import, atomic metadata/journal publication, uncertain
  commit inspected before cleanup, active slot preserved on lost ACK; cleanup
  only journal-owned prepared/retired Provider slots, no SQLite plaintext fallback.
- C5 locally approved target-owned canonical WearProviderBinding using existing
  OpenAI-compatible ProviderConfig; local SecretRef association, HTTPS-before-secret,
  binding-change invalidation/new endpoint credential reservation.
- C6 stable capability/readiness separation, AI preference OFF, single-flight
  10-second synthetic probe and 2/4/8/16/30 s backoff, no Agent write replay.
- C7 optional on-device STT, separate input/permission/language facts, explicit
  speech permission/model-download actions, no cloud or Phone microphone fallback.
- C8 Watch-local permission ceiling/confirmation: writes cannot relax to direct;
  bulk/destructive/external remain DENY. PhoneContextBridge is DEFERRED.

AGT-014 and SYN-018 record synchronized approved amendments. No server route,
schema, crypto implementation or D9-03 runtime is implemented in D9-03-00.
D9-03-00 subsequently passed final human review and merged as
`82f4c62e4ca772e9b1daf192760e2ff835067bcc`. The current D9-03-01 task explicitly
authorizes C1–C5 implementation; C6–C8 runtime work remains outside that slice.
OD-012 remains independently OPEN; no production-sensitive V3 composition is enabled.

## OD-059 — Provider mailbox post-expiry replay marker

```text
Status: RESOLVED FOR D9-03-01
Impact: SECURITY / PERSISTENCE / MAILBOX RETENTION
Source: PR #26 maintainer review; D9_03_00_WEAR_AGENT_PROVIDER_FREEZE.md §4.4
```

Maintainer approved a minimal indefinite server anti-replay tombstone after the
hard seven-day cutoff. Exactly `accountId`, `targetDeviceId`, `providerConfigId`,
`credentialRevision` and `DELIVERY_EXPIRED` remain. Account identifies authorization
ownership only; target-local state remains the sole revision allocator/authority.

Purge source assignment, ciphertext, encrypted-envelope digest, ACK result,
delivery created/expiry timestamps and all other delivery-specific data. Retain
no credential plaintext/hash, binding contents/digest, baseUrl/model, SecretRef or
ProviderConfig payload. This is the explicit C2 exception for a separate security
marker, not permission to retain ordinary delivery metadata indefinitely.

There is no time-based expiry or compaction policy for the marker. It remains
until a strictly higher target-owned reservation passes every existing exact-target,
ACTIVE source/target, same-account and valid-identity check, or a future explicit
permanent account/device identity deletion. Maintenance, credential wipe, binding
removal and source/target revocation must not reset the high-watermark.

Same expired revision always reports DELIVERY_EXPIRED to an authorized target,
including after arbitrary elapsed time/restart; lower revision rejects as
UNRESERVED_REVISION. Neither recreates source assignment, ciphertext or timestamps.
Only an eligible higher revision creates one new seven-day delivery window. Amend
the unmerged Server V10 in place with SQL CHECK-enforced minimal expired state;
do not introduce V11 or change C1–C8, wire/HPKE/SAS or local revision semantics.
